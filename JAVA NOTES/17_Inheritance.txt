  Assignment-17: Overriding and Overloading



1. 	Define a Java class Circle with radius as instance variable and setRadius(),
  	getRadius(), getArea() as instance method. Define a class ThickCircle as a
 	subclass of Circle with thickness as instance variable and getThickness(),
	setThickness() as instance methods. Provide an overridden method getArea() to
	calculate area of thick portion of circle.
2.	Define a class Person with name, age as instance variables. Define three
	overloaded versions of setPerson() in the class as instance methods, first version
	take name only, second version take age only, and third version take both.

3.	Define a rectangle class with length, breadth and border colour as instance
	variables. Provide instance methods setLength(), setBreadth(), setColour(),
	getLength(), getBreadth(), getColour() and printRectangleColour(). Create a
	subclass FilledRectangle of rectangle class with fill colour (inside region of
	rectangle) as instance variable. Provide setters and getters along with overridden
	method printRectangleColour() to display border colour as well as filled colour.

4.	Define a class Coordinate with x and y as instance variables. Define overloaded
	versions of getDistance(), first with no argument calculating distance from origin,
	and second with one argument of Coordinate type to calculate distance between
	two coordinates. Also define other methods if required.

5.	Define a class Person with name as instance variable. Provide setter and getters.
	Provide overloaded versions Of showName() method, one without argument to
	display name of the person and second with one argument title ("Mr" or "Ms") to
